Sign up on the main splash page, where you can then log in using your credentials. The App will ask you to enter your Gross Monthly Income, which is your total income after tax. From there, the App aims to break down a reasonable budget to apply to everyday expenditures such as liabilities, expenses and investments. 

Future additions to the project may include further breakdowns of each section that Wealthify budgets, as well as how the 50/30/20 strategy reinvests itself in the long run.
